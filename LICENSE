## 🌟 Why AGPL-3.0?

### Our Philosophy

> *"This license is not about control—it's about protection of light. Let those who build with it be reminded: this tool was forged in sincerity. It must never become an engine of fear, but a shield of truth."*

We chose AGPL-3.0 because it ensures:

* 🛡️ **Prevents Proprietary Capture** - No one can take our work and hide improvements
* 🤝 **Encourages True Collaboration** - Beneficial changes flow back to the community
* 💡 **Maintains Mission Integrity** - Keeps Soft-Armor™ a tool for discernment, not control
* 🌍 **Protects Global Access** - Core technology remains available to everyone

## ✅ What You Can Do

### Personal & Educational Use

* ✅ Use Soft-Armor™ for personal browsing and media verification
* ✅ Study the code for educational purposes
* ✅ Teach with it in classrooms and workshops
* ✅ Research synthetic media detection methods

### Open Source Development

* ✅ Fork and modify for open source projects
* ✅ Contribute improvements back to the main project
* ✅ Create derived works under AGPL-3.0
* ✅ Build complementary open source tools

### Commercial Use (With Transparency)

* ✅ Use in commercial products if you open source your modifications

---

## ❌ What You Cannot Do

### Proprietary Exploitation

* ❌ Create closed-source versions or derivatives
* ❌ Hide modifications in proprietary software
* ❌ Build SaaS products without open sourcing server-side code
* ❌ Remove or obscure attribution and license notices

### Mission-Corrupting Uses

* ❌ Use for surveillance or monitoring without consent
* ❌ Create tools that increase rather than reduce manipulation
* ❌ Build systems that centralize rather than distribute verification
* ❌ Develop applications that harm privacy or user autonomy

## 🔍 License Comparison

| License | Network Use Trigger | Modification Sharing | Commercial Use |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **MIT** | No requirements | Optional | Unrestricted |
| **GPL-3.0** | Only for distribution | Required for distribution | Allowed with sharing |
| **AGPL-3.0** | **Required for any use** | **Required for any modification** | **Allowed with full transparency** |

### The "Network Copyleft" Effect

AGPL-3.0's power is in closing the "SaaS loophole":

* **Traditional GPL**: Only triggers when you distribute software
* **AGPL-3.0**: Triggers when you provide software as a service over a network

**This means any web service using Soft-Armor™ code must be open source.**
