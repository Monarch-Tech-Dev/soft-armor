## üìä Data We DON'T Collect

### **No Media Upload**
- Images and videos you scan remain on your device
- No media files are ever transmitted to our servers
- All core processing happens locally in your browser

## üîç How Soft-Armor Works (Privacy-First)

### **Local Processing**
All core functionality operates entirely on your device:
- **C2PA Verification**: Certificate validation happens locally
- **AI Analysis**: TensorFlow.js models run in your browser
- **Video Processing**: OpenCV.js frame analysis stays local
- **Results Display**: All UI updates are client-side only

### **Network Requests (Limited)**
The extension makes minimal network requests only for:
- **Extension Updates**: Chrome Web Store automatic updates
- **Library Loading**: CDN resources for AI models (if not bundled)
- **C2PA Certificate Validation**: Public certificate authority lookups (standard web security)

## üí∞ Premium Features (Optional)

### **Opt-In Cloud Services**
Premium features require explicit user consent and include:

### **Premium Data Handling**
When you choose premium features:
